> # **Project Doggone**

### For my project I will be analyzing data obtained from the Austin Animal Shelter, which can be found here:
>>  https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Outcomes/9t4d-g238
<br> 

#### I will focus on the outcome data, to test my assumptions of what happens to dogs once they are in the shelter.  I will look at age, breed, and sex.  
#### I think that breed will have more of an impact on a dog’s outcome than age and sex.  I think Pit Bull mixes will have higher rates of a negative outcome and a higher rate of being in the shelter.
#### I think older dogs will have a higher death rate and lower adoption rate than young dogs.  I think males and females will be equal in all outcome categories.  

### Relevant Packages:
Jupyter Notebook (my project is an .ipynb file) <br>
Python 3 and higher <br>
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.pyplot <br>
I created my project on a Windows machine using Visual Studio Code and PowerShell creating a virtual environment in my Jupyter Notebook (kernel .venv Python 3.10.1)

### To Run Doggone:
For information on how to install and run Jupyter Notebook, please see the documentation at https://jupyter.org/install.jupyter.org

- Install Jupyter Notebook with: pip install notebook in order to run the notebook, dogs.ipynb
- Run the command jupyter notebook in the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac).
- Navigate to the project directory doggone and open the dogs.ipynb file

- Once the notebook has opened, select Kernel and Restart & Run All to run all cells in the file.

- Note: You might need to repeat the steps in this section to git clone and install requirements

- git clone https://github.com/happyhorseshoe/doggone.git

- Install required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt
<br>

### Alternative Instructions for running Doggone:

- Setup: Run git clone <your repo url.git> to clone the repository.
-  the directory for the project ('doggone'), run python3 -m venv venv to create the virtual environment.
- Activate the newly created python virtual environment. From the project directory run the following command:
>> - if using Windows Command Prompt: venv\Scripts\activate.bat
>> - if using Linux or Mac with bash/zsh: venv/bin/activate
- For additional help troubleshooting, see the "venv - Creation of virtual environments" documentaiton: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
- Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required packages.
- From the project directory, run python src\dogs.ipynb on Windows, or python src/dogs.ipynb on Linux/Mac, then follow the terminal prompts.

#### Please note that I use Markdown to explain each cell in my Notebook and show the below required features


### Feature List:
1.)	Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value and use it in your program. 

2.)	Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc. and use that data in your application.

3.)	Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data. Or, display data in a tabular form.

4.)	The program should utilize a virtual environment and document library dependencies in a requirements.txt file

### “Stretch” Feature List:
1.)	Use Pandas, Matplotlib, and/or NumPy to perform a data analysis project.  Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display. 

2.)	Use a Jupyter Notebook to document your data analysis.
